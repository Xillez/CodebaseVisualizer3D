# Where to start

Any contribution to this project starts at the issue page.

# Creating an issue

When creating an issue it is important to add a label. Please do not make more labels but use the default ones instead.

Briefly describe the issue and go into details only if necessary.

# Submitting code

If you want to submit code, make sure that an issue exists that the code will help with or solve. 

Try to keep the footprint of the code low so not to conflict with unrelated functionality. 

Try to keep the code style similar to the rest of the project.

Comment your code so that automatic documentation can be generated for functions and API.

When submitting the code, create a new branch, link the commit to the relevant issue, write a meaningfull commit message and create a pull request. Your code should then be checked by the core team.
